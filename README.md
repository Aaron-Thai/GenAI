# Outlook on Generative AI

This project is part of a collaboration between the [International Society of Service Innovation Professionals](https://www.issip.org) (ISSIP) and the [Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences](https://www.informs.org/) (INFORMS) via the Analytics Innovation Club (AI Club) at the University of Washington Tacoma.

## Goals
There are two main goals of this project:
1. Increase understanding of the various AI tools on the market.
2. Demonstrate how AI can be a useful service innovation by generating content for the ISSIP website.

To accomplish this, each person participates in testing three different AI tools. Our goal was to generate text, images, and video promoting certain service innovations. 

Our chosen service innovation was **Fitness Trackers** (fitbits and smartwatches).

## Documentation
The testing phase was split into three rounds. Click the links below to view detailed documentation on the AI tools. 
* Round 1: [Copy AI (overall rating: 3/5)](https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/blob/main/CopyAI.md)
* Round 2: [Playground AI (overall rating: 1/5)]((https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/blob/main/PlaygroundAI.md))
* Round 3: [Decohere AI (overall rating: 3/5)]((https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/blob/main/DecohereAI.md))

## Rating Scale
Ratings are based on how well each tool generated media from a scale of 0 to 5. 

| Rating | Reasoning                        |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 0      | Does not generate selected media |
| 1      | Below average performance        |
| 3      | Average performance              |
| 5      | Above average performance        |
