# Outlook on Generative AI

This project is part of a collaboration between the [International Society of Service Innovation Professionals](https://www.issip.org) (ISSIP) and the [Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences](https://www.informs.org/) (INFORMS) via the Analytics Innovation Club (AI Club) at the University of Washington Tacoma.

## Goals
There are two main goals of this project:
1. Increase **understanding of the various AI tools** on the market.
2. Demonstrate how **AI can be a useful service innovation** by generating content for the ISSIP website.

To accomplish this, each person participates in testing three different AI tools. Our goal was to generate **text, images, and video** promoting certain service innovations. 

Our chosen service innovation was **Fitness Trackers** (fitbits and smartwatches).

## Documentation
The testing phase was split into three rounds. Click the name of the Gen AI tool below to view detailed documentation. 
| Round | Tool | Overall Rating |

| 2     |  [Playground AI](https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/blob/main/PlaygroundAI.md)    | 1/5            |
| 3     |   [Decohere AI](https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/blob/main/DecohereAI.md)   | 3/5            |


## Rating Scale
Ratings are based on how well each tool generated media from a scale of 0 to 5. 

| Rating | Reasoning                        |
